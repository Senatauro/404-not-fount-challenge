## Overview

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This is a simple 404 page made for the devchallenges.io 1Â° responsive web developer challenge. This is the first challenge that I undertook from the [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) website. I always had a hard time with responsive web development, and taking this challenge as a test gave me the change to train more on the responsive side of things and to learn more about the responsive web development.

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo? [Here](https://master--magical-cat-5d5001.netlify.app/)
- What was your experience? UP
- What have you learned/improved? UP
- Your wisdom? Responsive web dev is hard
